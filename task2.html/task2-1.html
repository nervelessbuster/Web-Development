<h1>Cats and Dogs</h1>
<h4 class="mj">I have a cat, and am thinking of getting a dog. Will they fight?</h4>
<p>The idea that dogs hate cats may have been born because dogs chase <br>
cats and grew because cartoons depicted ongoing battles between the <br> 
two species. Or it may have been generated because soe dog people  <br>
 strongly disslike cats and some cat people disdain dogs. However, dogs <br>
and cats can live peaceably as long as owners understand the behaviors <br>
of each. </p>
<p>In some cases, a resident cat will isolate itself when a puppy is added <br>
to the family. In other cases, cats and dogs never get used to each <br>
other. In still other cases, cat or kitten and dog or puppy play together <br>
 and build a friendship that finds them curled up together in a crate or <br>
bed and drinking out of the same bowl. The type of relationship <br>
 developed in each households depends on the personality of the animals <br>
and the understanding of the owners.</p>
